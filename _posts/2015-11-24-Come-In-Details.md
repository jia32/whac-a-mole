We encountered some practical problems when we tried to code our project.

Our project need RTI (to reset the whole program), TIM (to select game mode, to play the game, and to calculate the reaction time.), ATD (this is for party mode, which we may not have time and energy to accomplish), and PWM (to make corresponding sound). And after we did the math we realized that we needed at least 25 pins for all of our input and output. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/layout.png)
*the given layout of 9S12C32*

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pins.jpg)
*the pins we need*

After consulting some friends, it seems that we can change the given layout of 9s12c. So we decided to hold on at this point and come back to code after we really changed the pin layout.
