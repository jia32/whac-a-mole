title: Building Prototypes
---

After discussion, I build two prototypes.

Here is the first prototype:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prototype1.jpg)

Basically, there are three part of this "machine": one part on the top with a LCD display and matrix of LEDs (3-color-LED), one part on the bottom with 5-6 big push buttons (with LED inside), and the other part of menu on the left side of pushbuttons, where the user could RESET, SELECT MODE, STOP.

This idea comes from ddr. The basic idea is that there are three modes:

**Party mode:** In this mode, all the LED on top will pop different colors at the same time(follow some pre-set pattern). And if you hit different pushbutton at the bottom, the LED will change color and keep popping. I am thinking if we have time and energy, we could add some filter and with the input of sound (wave), the LEDs could light up showing the waveform.

**Game mode:** In this mode, one column of LED will light up from top to bottom in turns, and the LED in the corresponding pushbutton will light up. And if you hit the pushbutton at this time, the “machine" will make a sound of the corresponding pitch/note. In this way, the user could learn to play simple songs.

**Music mode:** In this mode, the user could hit any pushbutton he/she wants and it will make a sound of corresponding pitch/note. The corresponding LED will light up from bottom to top one at a time.(similar to game mode, but in a different direction).

###Some analysis:###
**Pros:** This prototype looks fancier

**Cons:** It requires a lot of work （the matrix of LEDs would definitely require tons of work, and to make a song tutorial, we would need to carefully calculate the time between each note, etc.)

And here comes the second prototype:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prototype2.jpg)

Time for some real whac-a-mole!

Yes, this prototype looks like a real whac-a-mole arcade (but not as colorful). It is pretty self-explanatory. 

Basically, there are 9 pushbuttons (with LEDs in them). When they lights up one by one, the user should hit them and it would make a sound of corresponding pitch/note. And if the user is good and hit all the pushbuttons in time, it would make a song. If we have enough time and energy, we could make hard/easy mode, single hand/dual hand mode, etc.

On the right side of the prototype, there is LCD displaying score/menu. And there is menu where the user could RESET, STOP the game. We have a idea of put a prize inside and set a "gate" on the side of the prototype. And when the user get perfect score, the "gate" would open up and the prize goes out. This seems to be fun and not that hard to achieve.

###Some analysis:###
**Pros:** This idea is easier to make and more interesting

**Cons:** It seems other people have done similar stuff in the past, I am not sure if ours is different/better than theirs.
