After a round of voting, we decide to choose the first prototype.

And then we modified it. To make it sound better, we decide to let our "instruement" to make sound of CDEFGAB(center of course). And we decided to buy 7 pushbuttons with LEDs. In game mode, the LEDs will light up as the song plays to show the user that it is time to push the button to make some music.

*keyboard(an octave)*

And we decided to have 7 LEDs on top of each pushbutton. We were not sure of that if we really need all 3-color-LEDs for this part. Because by doing this, out project would looks prettier but the microcontroller have limited output port that there is no way all 7*7*3 pins could fit in. The best thing we should do is the output the result and using the shift register to shift down the signal from top to bottom and evantually to the pushbuttons. But, still, we want to make out project look fancy. So, we decide that we would use some similar technique as the stained glass in church to make the lights beautiful, without worry about 3-color-LED. Thus, we decided to buy 7*7 white LEDs.

*Stained Glass-I think we can achieve this by painting plastic board*

And then, we decided to add a 3-color-LED for each pushbotton, to indicate how well the user is playing. It is similar to the "Reaction" lab we did. These LEDs will light up red if user is too slow to respond, green if user push the button right in time, and yellow if user push the button after some time. So we bought 7 3-color-LED for this.

And then we went online and bought all the parts and hopefully they would delivered by Thanksgiving. We believe that wood boards are easy to get and we can always try to buy them in supermarket if we want.
